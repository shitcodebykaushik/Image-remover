# Language used 
This project is completely based on Rust language .
Its tym to be rusty....
# Here is the break down of code 
Here's a breakdown of what your code does:

Imports the necessary crates (error_chain, select::document::Document, select::predicate::Name).
Defines error types using the error_chain! macro. This macro generates code to handle errors related to reqwest (for making HTTP requests) and std::io (for file I/O operations).
Implements the main function as an asynchronous function (async fn main() -> Result<()>).
Uses reqwest to make an HTTP GET request to the URL "https://experience.dropbox.com/resources/what-does-sync-mean". The await? syntax is used to handle asynchronous operations and propagate errors.
Retrieves the response body as a string using the text() method.
Parses the HTML document using Document::from(res.as_str()) from the select crate.
Finds all <a> elements in the document using the find(Name("a")) method, which selects elements by tag name.
Filters out href attributes from the selected <a> elements using the filter_map(|n| n.attr("href")) method.
Prints each href attribute to the console using for_each(|x| println!("{}", x)).
Overall, your code fetches a webpage, parses its HTML content, and prints out the href attributes of all <a> elements found in the document.

If you have any specific questions or need further explanation on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
